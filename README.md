# Tad OS
_The simple, personalizable, standard conforming OS for newcomers and seasoned veterns alike_

This is an in-developement Linux-based OS which can be built using Bash build scripts. This repo will hold those build scripts, md5 files, etc. It can be built on any just about any system which the GNU toolchain and the Linux kernel support!
